# CGM-Social-Media-Analysis

## Data
Anupam Singh and the team at 113 Industries provided a sample of over 37K social media posts from a variety of sources related to CGMs (Continuous Glucose Monitors). Each row of the Excel file consists of a field of text called Sound Bite Text, along with a variety of other more structured metadata fields such as the source and when the Sound Bite Text field was extracted.

## Task
I worked within a team of four other students to analyze the social media data to derive any insights about CGMs whether it was about CGMs in general or about specific brands of CGMs. We broke our analysis into distinct parts

- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering and LDA Topic Modeling
- Product Specific Analysis
- General Product Sentiment Analysis

Since the data was in textual format, unstructured data analysis techniques and unsupervized learning were used. 

## Deliverables
- Code in Jupyter Notebooks
- Presentation outlining derived insights
- Report detailing in depth analysis of project.

## Specific Work
As part of this project, I outlined the project plan and separation of tasks initially. My work was mainly focused around customer segmentation using the unsupervized machine learning models.
